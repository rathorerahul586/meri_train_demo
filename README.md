**Meri Train** is a powerful and practical app designed for Indian Railway travelers — especially those holding **Waitlisted** or **RAC** tickets. It helps users identify **live seat availability**, track **coach positions**, and analyze **chart data** in real-time, even after receiving the chart-preparation SMS.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🔍 **Live seat-level availability**: Know exactly where a seat is booked and when it will be vacant between stations.
* 🪑 **Coach-wise seat mapping**: Visual view of seat occupancy across the entire coach.
* 📩 **SMS-based chart reading**: Auto-detect chart info from IRCTC's "Chart prepared" message.
* 🧾 **Manual message paste support**: Don't want to give SMS permission? Just paste the message.

## 🙋‍♂️ About the Project

This project was built to solve a **real-world travel pain point** for Indian railway passengers. Due to the suspension of the developer's Play Store account, the app is currently not available via Google Play — but it can still be sideloaded safely via APK.
